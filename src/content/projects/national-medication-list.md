challenge: |
  Previously when medical practitioners wanted to see what medications a new patient (not in current Electronic Medical Record) was taking they would have to go to an external service owned by the Swedish health authority.  This often meant that the practitioner would have to go out of the Kry system to get the details before prescribing any medicines to the patients. This meant time was wasted on the consultation switching between applications.
results: |
  With the integration of the national medication list to the Kry product practitioners could see the medications that the patient was taking without ever leaving the Kry system. This meant the practitioners saved multiple minutes every consultation. Leading to estimates of 10% more productivity for the 3000+ practitioners. Kry was the first care-provider to integrate towards the NLL.
process:
  - title: "Backend Design"
    description: "I was heavily involved in the design of the backend service and APIs. The functional and non-functional requirements had to be understood by reading the documentation provided by the eHM. The requirements had to be prioritized to scope the limit of the first MVP."
  - title: "Implementation"
    description: "The various features & functionalities needed to complete the integration for the MVP were split into smaller work packages to be finished within a set deadline. The features were implemented one by one and end to end tested with the frontend in stages."
stack:
  - Java
  - JavaScript
  - Spring
  - React
  - MySQL
  - DataDog
  - Kibana
  - Docker
  - AWS
conclusion: |
  I had to leave the project before the collaborative integration testing phase with eHM for the approval. My contributions to the project in planning, execution and implementation helped the project to stay on track and helped Kry to be the first care-provider to integrate towards NLL

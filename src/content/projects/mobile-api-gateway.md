challenge: |
  The existing corporate intranet was outdated, difficult to navigate, and 
  poorly organized. Employees struggled to find important information, 
  collaboration tools were scattered across different platforms, and the 
  overall user experience hindered productivity. The system lacked modern 
  features like search functionality, mobile responsiveness, and integration 
  with existing business tools.
results: |
  The optimized intranet delivered significant improvements in employee 
  productivity and satisfaction. We achieved a 20% increase in overall 
  productivity metrics, 95% employee satisfaction rating, and reduced 
  time spent searching for information by 60%. The new system also 
  improved internal communication efficiency by 45%.

  we delivered measurable improvements in productivity and satisfaction. The project
